Dear Grader,

  This semester was all but a great opportunity for me to learn about the field that I so dearly so far enjoy. I started off as a passionate programmer who knew very little of programming and wanted to take a path of learning all the essentials plus more of programming. Taking these essential courses with this instructional staff is something I am very grateful for as the sequence and order of material taught from 111 all the way here to 251 was a great way to mold someone who knew little of programming all the way to this point in their programming career. I wanted to say thank you to Professor Koehler and all the TAs for their hard work with teaching and grading and taking extra time out of their days to make sure people succeed in this class. Best wishes in all of your endeavors and thank you once again!

Best regards,
Ali Abuzir
